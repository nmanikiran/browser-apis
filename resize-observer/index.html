      changes to its size, with notifications being delivered to the observer
      each time the size changes.

        And remember, don't do anything that affects anything, unless it turns
        out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don't not

        You're not even robots. I've got to find a way to escape the horrible
        ravages of youth. Suddenly, I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork,
        every three hours. And those jerks at Social Security stopped sending me
        checks. Now 'I' have to pay 'them'!
